## About Me

👋Hi there! This is Xudong Yan (闫旭东). I am currently a Ph.D. student at Beijing Jiaotong University, supervised by Prof. [Songhe Feng](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8407/). Before transferring to the doctoral program, I pursued my master's studies at BJTU. Prior to that, I received my B.Eng. degree from Qingdao University.

My research interests focus on the application of vision-language models (VLM) in the real world, including their use in zero-shot and few-shot learning, multimodal retrieval, and test-time adaptation. If you are interested in our works or would like to explore potential collaboration, please feel very free to contact me via email🙌.

## Research Interests
